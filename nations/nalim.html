		<h3> Origins</h3>
		<p><b> Nalim </b> is an early empire spanning from it's origin of the Two gods in the <a href="../religions/nalingim.html">Nalingim</a> Religion. The name of the nation comes from when Naue and Neinum set the first stones to build their house. Every year, more and more people from nearby regions started to build along with them. Turning Nalim from a house to an Estate, until growing large enough to house tens of thousands of people.
