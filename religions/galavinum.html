	<h4>Tourum</h4>
	<p>Ulumum created the world by forging, pottery and painting. He created the Tourum first when attempting to forge a helmet. As the hammer hit the helmet, the sparks flew out and created the light source that the world revolves around. Tourum is constantly falling through the void together with all other sparks that have been created throughout his life. Some closer than others.</p>
	<h4>Tummum</h4>
	<p>After getting bored of forging he looked towards the accidental sparks that had been made, there was one that he took note of in particular, one brighter than the others. He decided to look closer and realised he wanted to create something deliberately. He started his potter wheel and created a sphere. He named the sphere "Tummum". Unbeknownst to him, Tummum and Tourum together caused peculiar accidents happening on Tummum. Small lifeforms began to form. We once again took a closer look and realised that the brown pottery is not good enough for his lifeforms, and as such decided to paint it with no creativity to spare. He painted bushes and trees with green leaves. He painted rivers and lakes blue. He painted fields and flowers in all different colors. </p>
	<p>Life started to flourish, and all lifeforms spread rapidly. Before he knew it, Tummum became self-sufficient and the entire sphere was covered in forests, oceans and life.</p>
