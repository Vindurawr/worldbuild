		<h3>Characteristics</h3>
		<p>The Oliumh is a very shy bird, mostly active during the sunrise. It sleeps between 5-11 þormn <i>(hour)</i> per Díagh <i>(day)</i> and will burrow the dirt with it's long beak to find any sort of small insect for food. Their mating Mínagh <i>(season)</i> is Mínþoragh, and will make 3-7 eggs per season.</p>
		<p>They are in general very bad flyers, their wings are most often too small to lift their bodies for an extended period of time. Only some smaller sub-species have the potential to fly further. Because of this they have developed an acute sense of burrowing.</p>
		<h3>Environment</h3>
		<p><b>Nesting</b> This bird lives in holes underneath trees, burrowing between the roots and the dirt.</p>
		<p><b>Range</b>	They live on <a href="../maps/ruibhren_fear.html">Féarruibhren</a> with some subspecies reaching further south to the general continent.</p>
